# Reflection-coefficient-computation
This project is part of my education. Made it for geophysics purposes.
## Computation of seismic wave's coefficient of reflection with Zoeppritz equations
To use this program run "Reflection_computation.exe" file. 
If you want to check out my code, you're welcome to run-through .py files.

## Tutorial
![Example-window-of-program](https://github.com/TamaraSavadyan/Reflection-coefficient-computation/blob/main/Reflection-Coefficient.JPG)
1) To compute wave reflection coefficient, you need to specify parameters of layers.
2) Enter velocity of primary (field "c") and secondary waves (field "b") and density (field "rho") of 2 layers. 
3) You can compute velocity of secondary waves using Puasson coefficient (field "sigma").
4) Specify layer type in dropdown menu (either solid or liqud).
5) Next enter type of wave you want to compute (either 'PP' for primary or 'PS' for secondary waves) 
6) You can enter title, name of xLabel/yLabel and path to folder, where you want to save computed result (.png type). But it's optional.
7) Press "Compute" button.

This steps will provide following result:
